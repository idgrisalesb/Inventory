Execute the BMAD 'create-user-guide' workflow.

CRITICAL: This is a structured step-file workflow. Follow these steps precisely:

1. LOAD the workflow definition from {project-root}/_siesa-agents/bmm/workflows/5-documentation/create-user-guide/workflow.md
2. READ its entire contents - this is the workflow entry point for creating user guides
3. UNDERSTAND the step-file architecture:
   - Each step is a self-contained instruction file
   - Steps must be executed sequentially
   - Just-in-time loading (only current step in memory)
4. EXECUTE each step file as directed by the workflow
5. SAVE outputs after EACH section when generating documents
