CRITICAL: This is a structured YAML workflow. Follow these steps precisely:

1. LOAD the gitflow use rules from {project-root}/_siesa-agents/bmm/data/gitflow/how-to-use.md
2. LOAD the UI Standards extension from {project-root}/_siesa-agents/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/dev-story/workflow_ext.md
3. LOAD the workflow definition from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/dev-story/workflow.yaml
3. PARSE the YAML structure to understand:
   - Workflow phases and steps
   - Required inputs and outputs
   - Dependencies between steps
4. EXECUTE each step in order
5. VALIDATE outputs before proceeding to next step
