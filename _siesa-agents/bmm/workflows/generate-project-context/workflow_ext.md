# siesa-ui-kit Logic in Generate Project Context Workflow

## Overview
In the workflow `@_bmad/bmm/workflows/generate-project-context/`, the `siesa-ui-kit` logic is primarily handled during the **Context Discovery & Initialization** phase (`step-01-discover.md`).

This workflow ensures that if company standards are present, the requirement to use `siesa-ui-kit` is extracted and elevated as a **Critical Implementation Rule** for all AI agents.

## Extraction Logic (Step 01)

### 1. Source Discovery
The workflow strictly looks for company standards in the following path:
- `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-architecture/data/company-standards/`

### 2. Critical Rule Extraction
When scanning the standards, the workflow is hardcoded to specifically look for and extract the following rule:

*   **Rule Identifier:** `siesa-ui-kit requirement`
*   **Description:** "Must check siesa-ui-kit before creating components"

### 3. Precedence Logic
*   **Company Standards > Discovered Patterns:** If the codebase shows patterns of using other generic components (like raw HTML or Shadcn directly without the kit), the `siesa-ui-kit` standard **overrides** those discovered patterns.
*   **Implementation:** The extracted rule is added to the `project-context.md` file under "Critical Implementation Rules", ensuring it becomes part of the permanent context for all future AI interactions.

## Output Specification
The final `project-context.md` generated by this workflow will effectively contain:

```markdown
## Critical Implementation Rules

- **Component Creation**: ALWAYS check `siesa-ui-kit` before creating any new component. Use existing kit components over custom implementations.
```

## Summary for AI Agents
When running this workflow, you must:
1.  **Verify** the existence of the company standards folder.
2.  **Confirm** the presence of the `frontend-standards.md` or similar file containing the kit requirement.
3.  **Enforce** the inclusion of the `siesa-ui-kit` rule in the final context document, treating it as a non-negotiable architectural constraint.

## References & Documentation
To ensure correct usage and adherence to standards, consult the following resources:

1.  **Siesa UI Kit Documentation (Primary Source):**
    - `https://siesa-ui-kit.netlify.app/llms.txt`
    - Navigate to this URL to understand the correct usage of each siesa-ui-kit component.

2.  **Frontend Development Standards:**
    - `@{project-root}/_siesa-agents/bmm/data/company-standards/frontend-standards.md`
    - Follow these general frontend standards when integrating siesa-ui-kit.

3.  **Technical & UX Preferences:**
