# Extension: Company Standards Context

As part of the Create Product Brief workflow, you must also load and consider the company standards.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. LOAD and READ all files in `@{project-root}/_siesa-agents/bmm/data/company-standards/`. wrapper script or simply list and read them.
   - architecture-patterns.md
   - backend-standards.md
   - database-conventions.md
   - frontend-standards.md
   - technical-preferences-ux.md
   - technology-stack.md
   - vite-config-standard.md
   (And any other files present in that directory)

2. Use the information in these standards to guide the product brief creation, ensuring alignment with the company's technical and design guidelines.

3. Ensure all proposed solutions and specifications in the Product Brief adhere to these standards.
