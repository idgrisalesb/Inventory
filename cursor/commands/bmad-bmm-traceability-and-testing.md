IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS - while staying in character as the current agent persona you may have loaded:

<steps CRITICAL="TRUE">
1. Always LOAD the FULL @{project-root}/_siesa-agents/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/traceability-and-testing/workflow.md
2. READ its entire contents - this is the workflow entry point for traceability and test planning
3. Follow workflow.md instructions EXACTLY as written to process the step-file architecture
4. Execute each step file sequentially as directed by the workflow
5. Save outputs after EACH section when generating any documents from templates
</steps>
