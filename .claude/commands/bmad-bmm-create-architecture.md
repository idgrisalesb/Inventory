IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS - while staying in character as the current agent persona you may have loaded:

<steps CRITICAL="TRUE">
1. ALWAYS Load and read the workflow extension from @{project-root}/_siesa-agents/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-architecture/workflow_ext.md to understand the Company Standards Context.
2. LOAD the FULL @{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-architecture/workflow.md
3. READ its entire contents.
4. If any instruction in the base workflow conflicts with 'workflow_ext.md', the extension file ALWAYS takes precedence.
5. Follow the workflow directions exactly!
</steps>
