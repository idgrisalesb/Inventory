# Git Attributes Configuration
# This file defines how Git should handle specific files during merges

# Package.json - Use union merge strategy to avoid conflicts
# This will combine changes from both branches instead of creating merge conflicts
package.json merge=union

# Alternative approach: You can also use ours or theirs strategy
# package.json merge=ours    # Always keep the current branch version
# package.json merge=theirs  # Always use the incoming branch version

# Lock files - typically should use ours strategy to maintain consistency
package-lock.json merge=ours
yarn.lock merge=ours
